These are some example apps that can be referenced for future coding needs. The examples include:
1. Deploying an exported SavedSearch (SearchKit) in an extension
2. Deploying an exported Afform (Form Builder) in an extension
3. Deploying a custom Angular.js app in an extension

## Getting Started

### Install and Activate the Extension
If not already, installed and activated, then do so and clear the CiviCRM cache.

### View the SavedSearch
The Saved Search can be found Under Packaged Searches on the *Saved Searches* page: /civicrm/admin/search#/list?tab=packaged

### View the Afform
The Search Form can be found in the Form Builder under *Search Forms*: /civicrm/admin/afform#/?tab=search

### View the Angular.js App (AngularExample)
The Angular.js app will run on /civicrm/a/#/senate/example/angular
